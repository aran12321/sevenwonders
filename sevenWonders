		<p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

    <h2>Christ the Redeemer</h2>
    <p>Christ the Redeemer is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone. Christ the Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project organisers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide.</phttps://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&ccid=gNZgzcLz&id=D936EB63954AC7E5D794A07898F15EAFB667E0EA&thid=OIP.gNZgzcLzsARwTEtP4Mh_NwHaEk&mediaurl=https%3a%2f%2fwww.onthegotours.com%2fblog%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2015%2f05%2fTreasury-dreamstime_xxl_52702433-crop.jpg&cdnurl=https%3a%2f%2fth.bing.com%2fth%2fid%2fR.80d660cdc2f3b004704c4b4fe0c87f37%3frik%3d6uBntq9e8Zh4oA%26pid%3dImgRaw%26r%3d0&exph=2472&expw=4000&q=petra&simid=608034663711923050&FORM=IRPRST&ck=E5C4366BEB92EFAB83743C66FE1B206B&selectedIndex=1>

    <h2>The Colosseum </h2>
    <p>The Colosseum is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus. Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian.</p>

    <h2>Petra </h2>
    <p>Petra , originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō, is a historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC. Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC, by which time Petra had become their capital. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.</p>
